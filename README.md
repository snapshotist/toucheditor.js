toucheditor.js
==============

A rich HTML editor designed specifically to be easy to use on touch devices.

**Project Status:** In development

This project is in the early stages. See touch_editor.html for a working demo. I don't recommend attempting to integrate this with any active projects yet, as there's a lot of code cleanup that's needed. Serious developers should feel free to mess with it.


**Upcoming changes:**
+ Code cleanup
+ Place hard-coded interface HTML on page into Javascript
+ Improved documentation
+ Improved CSS


**Known bugs:**
_None as of this version._
